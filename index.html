        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          This game is called "King of the Diamonds." It is completely made up
          and is similar to the childhood game, King of the Hill. Each player
          get 5 cards at a time. They cannont look at their cards. Each player
          takes turns placing their top card down. The person who has the King
          of Diamonds wins. When the player has finished with their 5 cards they
          must be dealt 5 more. If the deck is low enough and there are not
          enough cards for 5 more, then the game is a tie and nobody wins.
        </p>
